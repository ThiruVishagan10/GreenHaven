              Vels Nursery Garden
              Bringing Nature Closer to You Since 2013
              Vels Nursery Garden was started in 2013 by <b>Mr. T. Thangavelu</b> an agricultural expert with over 40 years of hands-on experience in farming, horticulture, and organic practices. A retired Additional Director of Agriculture, his passion for plants led him to start this journey in Manapakkam, Chennai, under the name Hortitech Nursery & Services.
              <br></br><br></br>From the very beginning, we‚Äôve been passionate about making gardening easy and accessible. In fact, we were among the first to introduce terrace gardening in Chennai, and we‚Äôve helped set up over 800+ terrace gardens across the city. We‚Äôve also partnered with the <b>MSME ‚Äì Government of India</b> to conduct training programs on terrace gardening, nursery development, and mushroom cultivation.
              Over the years, we‚Äôve worked on some amazing landscape projects for places like <br></br><b>Chennai Airport, Ennore Port, and Indian Oil</b> ‚Äì all backed by our deep understanding of soil, space, and sustainability.
